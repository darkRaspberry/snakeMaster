### Some of you ask WHY 😠 do you make a snake game?!!

Because snake🐍 in this game🎮 is very awesome. I will describe this in few points.
 - He is a vegan. His favorite food is a apple🍎.
 - He don't bite, except this own body. And die immediately. (So poisonous)
 - He always stays infront of the screen. He dies if he going far away from your sight.
 - He is generous. He understand my feelings and always follow my directions.

Enough?

Drop a star if you love it.
